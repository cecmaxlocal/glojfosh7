### A Full-Stack Application Framework powered by Libelula (NewLISP / dsLisp)

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-NewLISP-orange.svg)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-brightgreen.svg)
![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

**glojfosh7** is the reference implementation project for **Libelula**, a modern, lightweight framework for building full-stack applications using NewLISP and its powerful DSL-creation macro, `dsLisp`.

Like its namesake (Lib√©lula, Spanish for dragonfly), the framework aims to be fast, agile, and capable of navigating complex environments‚Äîfrom backend servers to desktop and web clients‚Äîwith the elegance and simplicity of a Lisp dialect.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Full-Stack Capabilities**: Build everything from backend APIs and web servers to interactive desktop applications from a single, cohesive codebase.
*   **Lisp-Powered**: Leverage the expressiveness, simplicity, and power of NewLISP for rapid development.
*   **Modular Architecture**: The project is cleanly separated into components (`App`, `Client`, `Desktop`, `Servers`, `Web`), making it easy to manage and scale.
*   **DSL-Oriented**: Heavily utilizes `dsLisp` to create domain-specific languages for routing, database interaction, and UI definition, resulting in clean and readable code.
*   **Lightweight & Performant**: Built on NewLISP, known for its small footprint and impressive speed.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The `glojfosh7` project is organized into distinct modules, each representing a core part of the Libelula framework.

```
glojfosh7/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App/         # Core application logic, business rules, and main entry points
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Client/      # Client-side code (e.g., API connectors, data models)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Desktop/     # Desktop application GUI and platform-specific logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Doc/         # Documentation, guides, and specifications for the framework
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Image/       # Image processing utilities, assets, and icon storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Servers/     # Backend server configurations (HTTP, WebSocket, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Web/         # Web-specific components (HTML templates, CSS, JS assets)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libelula.lsp # Main Libelula library entry point

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [NewLISP](http://www.newlisp.org/index.cgi?Download) installed on your system.

```bash
# Verify installation
newlisp -v
```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository into a directory named `glojfosh7`:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url> ./glojfosh7
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd glojfosh7
    ```
3.  The project is ready to run. Explore the different modules and examples.

## üí° Usage Example

Here is a simple example of how to start a web server using the Libelula framework.

Create a file `run_server.lsp`:
```newlisp
;; run_server.lsp

;; Load the core Libelula library
(load "libelula.lsp")

;; Use the web and server modules
(context 'Libelula.Web)
(context 'Libelula.Server)

;; Define a route for the root URL
(define-route "GET" "/"
  (lambda (request)
    (respond-html "<h1>Hello from Libelula!</h1>
                   <p>Your request was received from: { (request 'address) }</p>")))

;; Define another route with a parameter
(define-route "GET" "/user/:name"
  (lambda (request)
    (let (user-name (request 'params 'name))
      (respond-text (format "Hello, %s!" user-name)))))

;; Start the server on port 8080
(start-server :port 8080)

(println "Server listening on http://localhost:8080")
(while true (sleep 1000)) ;; Keep the script alive
```

Run the server from your terminal:
```bash
newlisp run_server.lsp
```

You can now visit `http://localhost:8080` and `http://localhost:8080/user/world` in your browser.

## üõ† Component Breakdown

*   **`./App`**: Contains the core business logic of your application. This is where you define your primary data structures and workflows, independent of the presentation layer.
*   **`./Servers`**: Holds all backend server definitions. You can configure different servers (e.g., a REST API server, a WebSocket server) and their specific modules here.
*   **`./Web`**: For all things web-related. Place your HTML templates (`.html`), CSS stylesheets, and client-side JavaScript files here. Libelula provides helpers for serving static assets from this directory.
*   **`./Desktop`**: If you are building a desktop application, this directory will contain the GUI definitions (e.g., using a library like GTK-server or a custom Tk binding) and logic specific to the desktop environment.
*   **`./Client`**: Contains code that might be shared between different types of clients (web, desktop, or even mobile). This could include API communication logic, data validation, and shared models.
*   **`./Image`**: A dedicated location for image assets and utility functions for processing them (e.g., resizing, format conversion).
*   **`./Doc`**: All project documentation, including API references, architectural diagrams, and developer guides.
