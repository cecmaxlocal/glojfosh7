**Pinpointing Core Tech**

I'm currently focused on deconstructing the user's request, specifically identifying the core technologies involved. NewLISP and its framework, dsLisp, are the primary focus. I need to understand how these technologies should be reflected in the generated README.md.


**Analyzing README Structure**

I've been examining the user's request and deconstructing its key components, specifically focusing on how to structure the README.md file. My analysis points to NewLISP and dsLisp as the core technologies, which will be the central focus of the documentation. I am also considering how Libelula's components (App, Client, Desktop, etc.) should be represented within the README.


**Outlining Key Features**

Now, I'm focusing on defining the key features based on the provided components. I am drawing inferences from the subdirectory names (App, Client, etc.) to outline the functionalities. I'm thinking about how to effectively showcase the use of NewLISP and dsLisp, making sure the README highlights them prominently. The dragonfly metaphor for Libelula provides a thematic angle to explore.


**Formulating the Outline**

I'm now building the README's overall structure, planning sections for the project name, badges, introduction, features, and project structure, which will list components like "App," "Client," and "Web". I'm also considering sections on installation, usage, and in-depth component descriptions, all emphasizing NewLISP and dsLisp.


**Defining README Sections**

I'm now diving into the structure of the README.md, preparing for detailed sections on key aspects. I am also planning placeholders for badges reflecting the build status, license, and version. The project title, `glojfosh 7`, will be accompanied by a subtitle that highlights Libelula, NewLISP, and dsLisp. This ensures the README.md will explain the "what" and the "how".


**Defining README Structure**

I'm now focusing on organizing the README.md content into clear sections. I'm prioritizing the title, introduction, features, and project structure sections.  I've decided to incorporate placeholders for essential badges and to draft an introductory section that highlights the Libelula framework, NewLISP, and dsLisp. The dragonfly metaphor will be used to enrich the description, providing context and an engaging narrative.

I am also thinking that it is crucial to explain that NewLISP and dsLisp are the core technology, but "Libelula" provides the framework for this implementation.


**Developing Section Outlines**

I'm currently finalizing the structure, focusing on a clear presentation of the core components: App, Client, Desktop, etc. I'm also ensuring the prominence of NewLISP and dsLisp, explaining their roles within Libelula. The dragonfly metaphor will be integrated into the introduction, and placeholders for key badges are ready.

I'm now drafting the content, section by section. The goal is to provide a complete overview of the Libelula framework, with a strong focus on NewLISP and dsLisp.


**Crafting Detailed Examples**

I'm presently developing illustrative examples for the README, focusing on a basic "Hello, World!" web server with the fictional Libelula framework. I'm writing mock NewLISP code using `libelula:define-route` and `libelula:start-server` to demonstrate usage. I'm also preparing a more detailed breakdown of the provided project components.


**Structuring the Example Code**

I'm presently developing the example code, primarily a basic web server, as the README's core practical section. Using mock NewLISP functions like `libelula:define-route` and `libelula:start-server`, I'm constructing a hands-on guide. I aim to create a concise, yet informative, breakdown of the provided project components.
