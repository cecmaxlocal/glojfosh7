;| Of course. The request for "studio.dslisp" sounds like you're looking for a way to use a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) in Lisp to define data structures (like countries and states) and then generate "program files" from them. This is a classic and powerful use case for Lisp.

Lisp is exceptionally good at this because its "code is data" philosophy allows you to create new syntax easily using macros. We will create a DSL that feels like a dedicated configuration language but is actually pure Lisp.

Here's a complete, structured development plan and the corresponding files.

### Conceptual Overview

1.  **The DSL (`dsl/`):** We'll create macros like `define-country` and `define-state`. These will be our custom language for describing geographical entities.
2.  **The Data Files (`data/`):** These are Lisp files that *use* our DSL to define specific countries and states. This is where you'll do most of your data entry.
3.  **The Core Program (`main.lisp`):** This program will load the DSL and the data files. It will then perform two actions:
    *   **Action 1 (Local State):** Populate in-memory Lisp data structures (like hash tables) for immediate use within the Lisp program.
    *   **Action 2 (Formed Program Files):** Generate external files from the in-memory data, such as a JSON file, which can be used by other programs (e.g., a web frontend).
4.  **Project Definition (`geography.asd`):** We'll use ASDF (Another System Definition Facility), the standard Lisp build system, to manage our project files and dependencies.

### File Structure

Here is the directory structure for our project:

```
/geography-project/
├── geography.asd             # ASDF System Definition
├── main.lisp                 # Main program to load and export data
│
├── dsl/
│   └── core.lisp             # The DSL implementation (macros)
│
├── data/
│   ├── usa.lisp              # Data file for the USA
│   └── canada.lisp           # Data file for Canada
│
└── generated/
    └── (empty, will be created)
```

---

### Step 1: Setting up the Project (`geography.asd`)

This file tells Lisp how our project is organized.

**`geography.asd`**
```lisp
 |;;;; geography.asd
;;;
;;; This file defines our system for ASDF.

(asdf:defsystem #:geography
  :description "A DSL for defining countries and states."
  :author "Your Name"
  :license "Public Domain"
  :version "1.0.0"
  :depends-on (#:jonathan) ; Dependency for JSON exporting
  :serial t
  :components ((:file "dsl/core")
               (:file "main")))
; ```

; **To use this, you'll need a JSON library. We'll use "Jonathan".**
; In your Lisp REPL, run this once: `(ql:quickload :jonathan)`

; ---

; ### Step 2: Creating the DSL (`dsl/core.lisp`)

; This is the heart of our system. We define the syntax for our new "language".

; **`dsl/core.lisp`**
; ```lisp
;;; dsl/core.lisp
;;;
;;; Defines the Domain-Specific Language for countries and states.

(defpackage #:geography.dsl
  (:use #:cl)
  (:export #:define-country
           #:with-country
           #:define-state
           #:*countries*
           #:*states*
           #:find-country
           #:find-states-in-country
           #:export-to-json))

(in-package #:geography.dsl)

;;; --- Data Storage (Our "Local State") ---

;; We'll use hash tables to store our data in memory.
(defvar *countries* (make-hash-table :test 'equal)
  "Stores country data, keyed by country code (e.g., \"USA\").")

(defvar *states* (make-hash-table :test 'equal)
  "Stores state data, keyed by a unique state identifier.")

;; We'll use structs to keep the data organized.
(defstruct country name code capital population currency)
(defstruct state name code capital population country-code)

;;; --- The DSL Macros ---

(defmacro define-country (name &key code capital population currency)
  "DSL to define a new country."
  `(setf (gethash ,code *countries*)
         (make-country :name ,name
                       :code ,code
                       :capital ,capital
                       :population ,population
                       :currency ,currency)))

;; This special variable will provide context for the `define-state` macro.
(defvar *current-country-code* nil)

(defmacro with-country (country-code &body body)
  "Provides a context for defining states within a specific country."
  `(let ((*current-country-code* ,country-code))
     ,@body))

(defmacro define-state (name &key code capital population)
  "DSL to define a new state. Must be used inside WITH-COUNTRY."
  `(unless *current-country-code*
     (error "DEFINE-STATE must be used within a WITH-COUNTRY block."))
  `(let ((state-key (format nil "~A-~A" *current-country-code* ,code)))
     (setf (gethash state-key *states*)
           (make-state :name ,name
                       :code ,code
                       :capital ,capital
                       :population ,population
                       :country-code *current-country-code*))))


;;; --- Helper Functions ---

(defun find-country (code)
  "Finds a country by its code."
  (gethash code *countries*))

(defun find-states-in-country (country-code)
  "Returns a list of all states for a given country code."
  (loop for state being the hash-values of *states*
        when (string= (state-country-code state) country-code)
        collect state))

(defun export-to-json (filepath)
  "Exports all country and state data to a single JSON file.
   This is how we create the 'formed program file'."
  (let ((output-data
          (loop for code being the hash-keys of *countries*
                for country being the hash-values of *countries*
                collect
                (let ((states (find-states-in-country code)))
                  `(:name ,(country-name country)
                    :code ,(country-code country)
                    :capital ,(country-capital country)
                    :population ,(country-population country)
                    :currency ,(country-currency country)
                    :states ,(mapcar (lambda (s)
                                       `(:name ,(state-name s)
                                         :code ,(state-code s)
                                         :capital ,(state-capital s)
                                         :population ,(state-population s)))
                                     states))))))
    (with-open-file (stream filepath
                            :direction :output
                            :if-exists :supersede
                            :if-does-not-exist :create)
      (format stream (jojo:to-json output-data :pretty t)))
    (format t "~&Successfully exported data to ~A~%" filepath)))
; ```

; ---

; ### Step 3: Using the DSL to Create Data Files

; Now, we create files that use our `define-country` and `define-state` language.

; **`data/usa.lisp`**
; ```lisp
;;; data/usa.lisp
;;;
;;; Data definitions for the United States using our DSL.

(in-package #:geography.dsl)

(define-country "United States of America"
  :code "USA"
  :capital "Washington, D.C."
  :population 331893745
  :currency "USD")

(with-country "USA"
  (define-state "California"
    :code "CA"
    :capital "Sacramento"
    :population 39237836)

  (define-state "New York"
    :code "NY"
    :capital "Albany"
    :population 19299981)

  (define-state "Texas"
    :code "TX"
    :capital "Austin"
    :population 29527941))
; ```

; **`data/canada.lisp`**
; ```lisp
;;; data/canada.lisp
;;;
;;; Data definitions for Canada using our DSL.

(in-package #:geography.dsl)

(define-country "Canada"
  :code "CAN"
  :capital "Ottawa"
  :population 38246108
  :currency "CAD")

(with-country "CAN"
  (define-state "Ontario"       ; In Canada, they are provinces
    :code "ON"
    :capital "Toronto"
    :population 14734014)

  (define-state "Quebec"
    :code "QC"
    :capital "Quebec City"
    :population 8575944))
; ```

; ---

; ### Step 4: The Main Program to Load and Export

; This file ties everything together. It loads the data into the "local state" and then runs the exporter to create the final file.

; **`main.lisp`**
; ```lisp
;;; main.lisp
;;;
;;; Main program entry point.

(defpackage #:geography.main
  (:use #:cl #:geography.dsl))

(in-package #:geography.main)

(defun load-data-files ()
  "Loads all data definition files from the data/ directory."
  ;; A more robust solution would scan the directory.
  ;; For this example, we'll load them explicitly.
  (load (asdf:system-relative-pathname :geography "data/usa.lisp"))
  (load (asdf:system-relative-pathname :geography "data/canada.lisp"))
  (format t "~&Data files loaded successfully.~%"))

(defun main ()
  "Main function to run the program."
  ;; 1. Load the data into the Lisp environment ("local states")
  (load-data-files)

  ;; 2. Demonstrate using the local state
  (format t "~%--- Demonstrating Local State Access ---~%")
  (let ((usa (find-country "USA")))
    (when usa
      (format t "Found country: ~A~%" (country-name usa))
      (format t "States in USA: ~A~%" (mapcar #'state-name (find-states-in-country "USA")))))

  (terpri) ; Print a newline

  ;; 3. Generate the "formed program file" (JSON)
  (format t "~%--- Generating Formed Program File (JSON) ---~%")
  (let ((output-path (asdf:system-relative-pathname :geography "generated/geography.json")))
    ;; Ensure the directory exists
    (ensure-directories-exist output-path)
    (export-to-json output-path)))

;; You can run (geography.main:main) at the REPL to execute this.
; ```

; ---

; ### How to Run Everything

; 1.  **Setup:** Make sure you have a Common Lisp implementation (like SBCL), Quicklisp, and the project files arranged as described above.
; 2.  **Start Lisp:** Open your Lisp REPL.
; 3.  **Load Prerequisite:** `(ql:quickload :jonathan)`
; 4.  **Locate Project:** Tell ASDF where to find your project. The easiest way is to push the project's parent directory to `asdf:*central-registry*`. If your project is in `~/lisp/geography-project/`, you would do:
;     ```lisp
;     (push #p"~/lisp/" asdf:*central-registry*)
;     ```
; 5.  **Load System:**
;     ```lisp
;     (asdf:load-system :geography)
;     ```
; 6.  **Run the Main Function:**
;     ```lisp
;     (geography.main:main)
;     ```

; ### Expected Output

; **In your REPL, you will see:**
; ```
; Data files loaded successfully.

; --- Demonstrating Local State Access ---
; Found country: United States of America
; States in USA: ("California" "New York" "Texas")

; --- Generating Formed Program File (JSON) ---
; Successfully exported data to /path/to/your/geography-project/generated/geography.json
; ```

; **A new file will be created:** `generated/geography.json`

; **`generated/geography.json`**
; ```json
; [
;   {
;     "name": "Canada",
;     "code": "CAN",
;     "capital": "Ottawa",
;     "population": 38246108,
;     "currency": "CAD",
;     "states": [
;       {
;         "name": "Ontario",
;         "code": "ON",
;         "capital": "Toronto",
;         "population": 14734014
;       },
;       {
;         "name": "Quebec",
;         "code": "QC",
;         "capital": "Quebec City",
;         "population": 8575944
;       }
;     ]
;   },
;   {
;     "name": "United States of America",
;     "code": "USA",
;     "capital": "Washington, D.C.",
;     "population": 331893745,
;     "currency": "USD",
;     "states": [
;       {
;         "name": "California",
;         "code": "CA",
;         "capital": "Sacramento",
;         "population": 39237836
;       },
;       {
;         "name": "New York",
;         "code": "NY",
;         "capital": "Albany",
;         "population": 19299981
;       },
;       {
;         "name": "Texas",
;         "code": "TX",
;         "capital": "Austin",
;         "population": 29527941
;       }
;     ]
;   }
; ]
; ```

; This complete example shows how Lisp can be used to create a custom "studio" environment where you define data in a clean, domain-specific way, and then compile or transform that data into different formats for other programs to use.
